## *About the Collection*

At the Santa Claus Museum & Village you can find a wide variety of artifacts focused around the local town history and the families that made Santa Claus Land (now known as Holiday World & Splashinâ€™ Safari) and the town of Santa Claus, Indiana what it is today. Within the museum you will also see a large collection of trains, dolls, Santa Claus memorabilia, Santa Claus Land souvenirs, and the famous letters to Santa - written by children dating back to the 1930s. 

This digital collection is comprised of a tiny fraction of total artifacts and items you can find at The Santa Claus Museum & Village. The items you'll find here were chosen to be a representative sample of the types of artifacts you will find in person at the museum, but it by no means is meant to be the *only* types of items you will find within the collection. 

As you look through the collection you will find a lot of items that are souvenirs. 

## *The Letters*

The Dear Santa letters that have been included for this digital collection are some of the earliest letters that were saved and in relatively okay condition (1930s-1949). They are all worth the time reading through! It is really fascinating to read letters from children during such a tumultuous and grim time in America. One popular item for young girls was a "rubber doll that wets itself," while for the young boys they would like mouth organs and air riffles. Meanwhile there is one young girl who asks for a bed to sleep on. There can be a lot found within these letters to Santa. Some write quick messages, simply stating what they want for Christmas. While others seem to need a writing outlet to describe happenings in their life. They also come from children (and adults) outside of Indiana and the United States. A group of children from South Africa took the time to draw what they would like Santa to bring them.
